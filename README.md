routefinder
===========

This is my repository of "Route Finder" a Social web application for RV trips where users can look for, share, rank and create new routes and places, using the geolocation tool of GoogleMaps.

- It is written in Ruby on Rails 2.3, HTML, CSS, some jQuery javascript, and Google Maps API. 

- Users can sign-up and start adding favorites places/routes, creating new ones, or ranking and commenting the others.

- Users can create their own places looking for them by address or GPS coordinates in the form.

- Users can create their own routes adding any place to the route.

- The GoogleMaps API will show the route in the map and will show also the steps in a list.

- It is in development, so still have some bugs.


You can see it running online at: http://routefinder.heroku.com/


Enjoy!
